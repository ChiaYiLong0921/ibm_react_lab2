Step 3: Create event handling
In this step, you will create events that will handle the clicks performed on the likes and dislikes buttons.

Create two event handlers under the this.state object with the name handleLike for the like button and handleDislike for the dislike button.

      handleLike:() => {
      },
      handleDislike:() => {
      }
  }
    }

Now, in these two events handlers write the code logic to increase and decrease the likes and dislikes button values.

    this.state = {
      likes: 0,
      dislikes: 0,
      handleLike:() => {
        this.setState((prevState) => ({
          likes: prevState.likes + 1
        }));
      },
      handleDislike:() => {
        this.setState((prevState) => ({
          dislikes: prevState.dislikes + 1
        }));
      }
  }
    }

In the above code, the arrow functions, handleLike and handleDislike, are called when the user clicks the "like" or "dislike" button, respectively.
The functions utilize the setState method to update the component's state. Inside setState, the previous state (prevState) is accessed, which holds the previous state of the component before the update.
Then the likes or dislikes count is incremented by one and set as the new state value.
This ensures that each button click accurately updates the corresponding count in the component's state.

Step 4: Call event handlers
Now you need to call these event handlers using the click of like and dislike button.

For this, you need to use the onClick event on buttons and call handleLike and handleDislike on Likes and Dislikes buttons, respectively, as shown in the given code.

 <button className="like-button" onClick={this.state.handleLike}>
            Like ({this.state.likes})
          </button>
          <button className="dislike-button" onClick={this.state.handleDislike}>
            Dislike ({this.state.dislikes})
</button>
